# Tablio [under construction]

A Table Service webapp designed at making bars and resturants as contactless as possible. 

Users are able to access their tables order through a QR code, and can then order drinks and other items for their table.
The staff of the bar/resturant have access to a seperate UI that tracks all tables orders in real-time and allows them to fulfil orders from a distance (except for when serving the order to the patron). 

Tablio is built using React, Redux, Google Firebase, Node and WebPack.
